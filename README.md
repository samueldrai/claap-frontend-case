# Frontend case Claap

Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Please find my work on the front-end case.

I did my best to implement all the requested features.
It was a really fun case to work on. The ComboBox was an interesting feature to develop (it was a bit tricky though).

I tried to make the `ComboBox` component as close as possible to a real component (reusable and with clear prop names)

## How to run

Simply clone the repo and run:

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

The app should start on `http://localhost:3000`
